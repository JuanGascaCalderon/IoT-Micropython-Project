# IoT-Project-Micropython▶️🤷‍♂️

The **Internet of Things (IoT)** plays a key role in **Industry 4.0** by enabling the connectivity and communication of networked devices, sensors and systems. This enables real-time data collection, process optimization, automation and autonomous decision making, thus driving efficiency, productivity and innovation in industrial environments. 🤞

Because of this, this repository consists of the implementation of an IoT project for the control of a **conveyor belt with die cutter**‼️ using the **Fischertechnik**⚡ educational building system. Fischertechnik is an educational build system that uses modular kits to explore engineering and technology concepts through the construction of functional models and the integration of electronic components. It is used in educational settings and hobby projects.🌐

In the IoT project, the programming of the conveyor belt with die cutter was performed using **MicroPython**😍. MicroPython is an implementation of the Python programming language optimized for microcontrollers and low-power devices. It enables simple and efficient programming of IoT devices, providing flexibility and the ability to interact with sensors, actuators and other components. In this case, MicroPython was used to control the operation and automation of the conveyor belt and die cutter, allowing its integration and operation in the context of the IoT project..🫡
